# Buzz
## [Possible Problems](https://www.fender.com/articles/how-to/buzz-off-how-to-deal-with-fret-buzz)
* uneven frets
* low action
* worn nut
* neck relief
* strings

## Overview
1. check neck angle
2. check fingerboard radius
3. check neck relief
4. check string action

## Angle
* when do you need to adjust neck angle
    * Mainly, the angle at which the neck is seated in the neck pocket affects how low the bridge must be set in order to achieve optimal playing action (string height above the fingerboard.
    * the action can still be too high even after setting the bridge (or bridge saddles) as low as possible.

## Fingerboard Radius
* Fingerboard Radius === arc of the fingerboard across its width
    * === degree of curvature
* radius of Fender Player is 9.5"
* larger radius === flatter fingerboard
* compound-radius fingerboard
    * Such a fingerboard, for example, may have a 9.5” radius at the headstock end and a 14” radius at the body end; other compound-radius designs used by Fender include 7.25”-12” and 12”-16”.
    * rounded part near headstock is good for chording
    * flatten part near body is food for soloing
* the action of strings
    * typically set at the bridge to match the curvature of the fingerboard radius more or less exactly
* On instruments with compound-radius fingerboards, string height is typically set to match the fingerboard radius basically in the middle of the scale length; i.e., at or near the 12th fret.


## Relief
* How to measure
    * capo on first fret
    * fret the last fret
    * measure gap between string and fret
        * eighth fret
        * low and high E string
* proper gap
| radius | relief |
| -- | -- |
| 7.25" | .012" (0.3 mm) |
| 9.5" - 12" | .010” (0.25 mm) |
| 15"-17" | .008” (0.2 mm) |

* [Adjust Truss Rod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKtlsps4SqY)
    * too tight
        * buzz (back-bow)
    * too loose
        * action too high (up-bow)
    * adjustment
        * tighten (clockwise)
        * losen (counterclockwise)
    * eighth of a circle of each turn

## String Action
* String Action height need to fit fretboard radius
* measure 12th and 17th fret to make sure you don't have compounded radius fretboard
* use allen key wrench to adjust saddle
    * anti clockwise === lower
    * clockwise === higher
* saddle should be flat without any tilt
* proper action
    1. 12th fret
        * sixth: 3/32" (2.38mm) (2 - 2.5)
        * first: 2/32" (1.58mm) (1.5 - 2)
    2. adjust the rest of strings to fit the radius gauge

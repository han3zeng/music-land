## Terms
* picky hand (to me is right hand)
* pick: use pick to pick the string
    * alternative picking
        * down and up
    * economy picking
        * you decide down or up for each note
        * Economy picking: Maximizing your efficiency with the way you choose to pick notes in a song – that is, whether to use alternate picking or to repeat downstrokes or upstrokes
* P.M === Palm Muting
* resolve chord (like a root ??)
* Pull-off: Lifting your finger off the fretboard so you can play a lower note on the same string without picking again
* Hammer-on: The opposite of a pull-off, you play a string open and then place your finger on the string to play a higher note without needing to pick again
* Tritone: An interval of three whole tones
    * E to A#
* 5th chord: A power chord is sometimes referred to as a 5th chord – e.g. E5 is an E power chord. This is because a power chord consists of only two notes that are a perfect fifth interval apart

## Practice
1. Wondrous Melody (pdf)
2. E major scale (open string)
    * improvise with backing track

## Question
* first note of happy birthday is the fist note or fifth note of scale
    * solve by myself, interval only means the distance between two note and it is not related to the key of the song
    * So the happy birthday song start at the fifth note of the scale. The first interval is the sixth note of the scale. The sixth note is the major second of the fifth note

Amplifier: A device which increases the amplitude of a signal.

Balanced Audio: A type of audio signal which uses two inverted voltages as a way to prevent unwanted noise being picked up by cables.

Bus: The pathway along which an electrical signal flows. For example, the output of a sound mixer is referred to as the master stereo bus.

Channel: Similar to a bus, a pathway through an audio device. For example, sound mixers have multiple input channels.

Compression: A method of "evening out" the dynamic range of a signal.

DAW: Digital Audio Workstation (like Logic, Pro Tools, Studio one etc.)

Decibel (dB): Logarithmic measurement of signal strength.

Equalization: The process of adjusting various audio frequencies to correct or enhance the sound.

Fade: A transition to or from silence.

Frequency Response: The sensitivity of an audio device to various frequencies, i.e. the amount each frequency is boosted, attenuated or reproduced.

Gain: The amplification level of an audio signal.

Hertz: Unit of frequency, cycles per second.

Headroom: In a cable or audio device, the difference between the maximum level of the signal being carried and the maximum level the device is capable of carrying without distortion. Headroom is safety room.

MIDI: Musical Instrument Digital Interface. A standard of communication between musical instruments, controllers and computers.

Mixer: A device which accepts two or more audio inputs and provides one or more audio outputs.

Peak: The highest level of strength of an audio signal. Often refers to an unacceptably high level, where the signal begins distorting.

Phantom Power: A DC current which is sent through audio cables to provide power for devices such as microphones.

Reverb: Reverberation, the effect of sound waves bouncing off walls and other objects.

Sample: In digital audio recording, thousands of individual "samples" are recorded every second. Added together these make up the digital audio signal.

Stereo: Audio which is made up of two channels â€” left and right.

Wavelength: The length of a wave, measured from any point on a wave to the corresponding point on the next phase of the wave.

XLR: A lockable connector, available with various numbers of pins. The most common XLR in audio work is the 3-pin XLR. Most microphones use XLR.

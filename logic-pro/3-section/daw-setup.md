## Overview
* bit depth
* sample rate
* buffer size

## [Bit Depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth)
* value
    * 8: not good
    * 16: close to noise floor
    * 24: standard
    * 32: better

* definition
    *  bit depth is the number of bits of information in each [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing))
        * sample is a value or set of values at a point in time and/or space

* higher
    * larger dynamic range
        * less noise floor when you turn up the volume of track

## Sample Rate
* how many times your computer takes a snapshot of the audio every second

* high sample rate
    * good for editing/stretching out the audio track
    * can capture ultrasonic frequencies. Some people argue that the ultrasonic frequencies can improve the quality of sound even though you can't hear it

* value
    * 44.1: okay
    * 48: standard
    * 88.2: good for editing
    * 96: goo for editing
    * 192: edit heavily

## Buffer Size
* value
    * recording
        * <= 69
    * mixing
        * >= 1024

* overview
    * The buffer size is the amount of time you allocate to your DAW for processing audio.
    * do not affect the quality of your audio

## Terms
* dynamic range
    * the difference in volume between your recorded audio and the noise floor
    * the difference in decibel between loudest and softest signal that device can handle
    * the difference between softest and loudest sounds of an audio signal
    * example
        * 16 bit digital audio: dynamic range === 96dB
    * tool
        * compressor to limit the dynamic range
        * expander to increate the dynamic range
* [noise floor](https://ourdaysrecords.com/class/reduce-guitar-noise/)
    * noise
        * hum sound create from equipment/device
    * Noise floor refers to the amount of noise a piece of equipment naturally creates.
        * small amount of noise generated by all of the electronic components of your recording gear
    * solution
        * noise gate pedal || high-passed filter

* gain v.s volume
    * volume
        * decibel(dB) output of a system
            * how loud something is after it’s been processed.
        * only change loudness not tone of sound
    * gain
        * generally
            * decibel (dB) input of a system.
                * how loud something is before it goes through any processing
            * change the tone of sound
        * compressor
            * the “makeup gain” function === output volume
        * guitar
            * distortion

* gain staging
    *


* master v.s volume
    * the first volume controls the amount of signal going through the preamp section.
    * the second volume (master volume) controls the amount of signal going through the power amp section.
    * most usually, people dial in some distortion in the preamp section using the first volume control, then use the master volume to control the overall loudness of the amp.

# headroom
    * safe sound zone without distortion
